<div class="about-container">
  <h1>Recruitment task</h1>
  <p>Write application in Angular. The People and About tabs are separated pages (router outlets):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>People tab should display random user from randomuser.me API (photo and name). If
      user clicks the “New” button the data should be reloaded with new data from API. Also
      every 5 seconds data should be reloaded, but the timer should reset every time user
      clicks “New” button and timer should stops couting if user’s cursor is under photo, name
      or button (prevents from reloading data when for example user trying to copy name).
    </li>
    <li>About is a static page with text description of the recruitment task (you're currently
      reading it).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Both pages should looks similar to the attached graphics. Please focus on code readability and
    application performance (imagine that these are only 2 subpages of a huge application).</p>
  <p class="documentation">Application should use the randomuser.me API. <br>
    See <a target="_blank" href="https://randomuser.me/documentation">https://randomuser.me/documentation</a>  for more information.
